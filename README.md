# Development forum

This repository contains the BioXARZ-2 development forum, which is an easier
way to tell your ideas and questions to the developers, but in a more
centralized and not so confusing way. Its purpose is the same as that of a
common forum for a project or video game, being an alternative to the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/dxq5uvyDJB) server.

## Rules

On this server you can chat with our community about topics related to
BioXARZ-2, which can be your opinions, feelings and even asking for help, but
first of all, you must follow the following rules:

* Discuss the topic of the respective category and forum.
* Do not offend and disturb members.
* Do not post inappropriate or controversial content.
* Do not do promotions.

You will be expelled from the forum if you violate any of these rules
repetitively or maliciously, since we do not want to expose our community to
unpleasant people.

If you notice that a member has violated the rules, you can report it to our
[email](mailto:bioxarz2@gmail.com).
